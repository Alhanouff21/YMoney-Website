            <h4>Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD)</h4>
            <p>The Kuwaiti dinar is the strongest currency in the world, with 1 dinar buying 3.26 dollars (or, put
                another way, $1 equals 0.31 Kuwaiti dinar).
                Kuwait is located on the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and the country earns much of its
                wealth as a leading global exporter of oil. The Kuwaiti dinar was introduced in the 1960s and was
                initially pegged to the British pound before being re-pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies.</p>

                Bahrain is an island nation in the Persian Gulf off the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia.
                Like Kuwait, the country earns much of its wealth from oil and gas exports. The Bahraini
                dinar entered circulation in 1965 and is pegged to the dollar.</p>

                equals 0.38 Omani rial).
                Oman sits between the United Arab Emirates and Yemen at the eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
                As with its wealthy neighbors, Oman is a major exporter of oil and gas. The Omani rial was
                introduced in the 1970s and is pegged to the dollar.</p>

            <h4> Jordanian Dinar (JOD) </h4>

                $1 equals 0.71 Jordanian dinar).
                Jordan is a largely landlocked country in the Middle East that is less dependent on
                oil and gas exports than other nations in the region. It has struggled with sluggish economic growth and
                rising debt.
                The Jordanian dinar entered circulation in 1950 and is pegged to the dollar.</p>

            <h4> Gibraltar Pound (GIP) </h4>
            <p>The Gibraltar pound shares the No. 6 spot among the world’s strongest currencies, with 1 pound buying
                1.22 dollars (or $1 equals 0.82 Gibraltar pound).
                Gibraltar occupies just 2.6 square miles at the southern tip of Spain and is officially a British
                territory.
                The Gibraltar pound was first introduced in the 1920s and is pegged to the British pound (at par,
                meaning one GIP equals one GBP).</p>

                dollars (or $1 equals 0.92 Swiss franc).
                The Swiss franc is the official legal tender of Switzerland and its tiny neighbor Liechtenstein, and the
                currency is seen as a safe haven due to Switzerland’s political stability.
                The Swiss franc was introduced in 1850 and was later briefly pegged to the euro before moving to a
                free-float.</p>
